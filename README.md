# Group an array script

To access this repository just clone it:
git clone https://github.com/PabloCaDa/groupAnArray.git

Once you own the code, you just have to open the index.html into your favourite browser and you will see a message like this:
> Open your console and test me!

So follow the instructions and open the console. Once you do this, you will find two ways to solve the problem by executing two different methods.

##1. By Using Vanilla JS:

  Execute this function with the parameters you want:
    `groupAnArrayVanillaJs(array, divisor)`

##2. By Using Lodash:

  Execute this function with the parameters you want:
    `groupAnArrayByChunk(array, divisor)`
